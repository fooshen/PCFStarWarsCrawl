# PCFStarWarsCrawl
Power Apps Component Framework - animated text in style of Star Wars movies' opening crawl
CSS animation trick based on this example by Geoff Graham https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/star-wars-crawl-text/

Solution files (managed & unmanaged) in folder PCFStarWarsCrawl/SWCrawlSolution/. Source code in folder /StarWarsCrawl.
Sample app (with bonus Lightsaber on/off animation) is a Canvas App export - ANZPowerHourDemo_20220504010656.zip. This is not a solution package - go to https://make.powerapps.com/, select "Apps" and select "Import canvas app" after you have imported the PCF solution.
